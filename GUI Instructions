Hey guys. As you can see, the GUI version of the encoder is now released!

To use it, just download the program and run it. It should pop up with a small window with some components.

You should see two radio buttons, labeled Encode and Decode. At the beginning, both are checked. Uncheck one of them to make sure there is no glitches.

Then you should see a text input, with two buttons next to it.

The first button is translate, and the second one is Quit. Quit obviously qutis the application. But the translate button does the action

To actually translate, choose an option, either Encode or Decode. Type your text in for encode, or paste in a message for decode. Then press translate, and the text will automagically change to either plain text or a jumble of numbers. 

And that's it for that, thanks for supporting!

Upcoming features are separate sets of ciphers and a better GUI.
